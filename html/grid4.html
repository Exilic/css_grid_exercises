      <h1>Reference to the world</h1>
      <p>
        Words refer to the world in different degrees of specificity. To refer
        to a person as &raquo;Elizabeth II&laquo; or &raquo;the Queen&laquo;
        differs in degrees of specificity. The latter reference depends to a
        higher degree on context to gain specific reference to the world.
        Talking in the United Kingdom about &raquo;the Queen&laquo; will connect
        the recipient of the words with Elizabeth II. Doing the same in Denmark
        will connect the recipient of the words with Margrethe II. A word of
        much less specificity, &raquo;she,&laquo; will gain specificity in a
        sentence if it follows directly after a sentence containing the name
        &raquo;Elizabeth II.&laquo; Some sentences later, the word
        &raquo;she&laquo; will follow another name and the specific reference of
        &raquo;she&laquo; will have changed. A different kind of speech
        situation, but with a similar function, would be a person pointing at a
        picture of Elizabeth II and saying &raquo;she.&laquo;
